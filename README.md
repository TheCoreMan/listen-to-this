## What is this?
### MVP
1. Go to <http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis>
2. Sort by "top" of the last X days
3. Go over the first X submissions
4. From them, find the one which is considered "best" by YouTube metrics (e.g. most views or most likes or best likes to dislikes ratio)
5. play that one :)

### Future
* filter by genre
* auto-create youtube playlists
* reddit bot that replies each time a song is selected with `I put this song in this playlist!`
* save results in longterm DB and create statictics over most popular genres
